	Things we need to do, and figure out how to do it
	
	- grab information from our db, and write that to a csv file
	- save the csv file do the computer (desktop if possilbe)
	- remove all those values from our db
		- should leave the last checkout entry for any devices still left out
	- the db should be cleared out every two weeks? month?
